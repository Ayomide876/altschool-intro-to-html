        <p>The song was made for a film about Louis Zamperini His life story is astonshing and inspiring. He was an Olympic athlete and World War II hero who survived a plane crash, 47 days adrift at sea, and over two years of horrific captivity in Japanese prison camps.</p>
        <p> Enduring unthinkable hardship, he struggled with trauma after the war but ultimately, he  found peace through faith, forgiveness, and reconciliation.
